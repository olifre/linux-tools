# linux-tools
A random collection of tiny Linux tools.

## Disclaimer
These tools come with almost zero documentation! The repository is a playground to collect potentially useful code I developed for tests or other experiments.

Use at your own risk!

## memlock
A simple C/C++ tool to allocate a given amount of bytes and try to memlock all of that.
